## Kaggle Competition - Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction

### overview
The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businesses–only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. 
As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.



In this competition, you’re challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) 
customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better 
use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.

### Data:
provided by google. available at :https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/data

### Prerequisites:
 - python libraries(numpy,pands,matplotlib.,etc)
 - machine learning algorithms.
 - Data pre-processing techniques.
 
### Regarding files:
 - case_study.ipynb : This file contains everything from data collection, preprocessing, EDA, features building, Model building
 - PipeLine.ipynb : In this file we implemented final pipe-line from scratch(with out using sklearn pipe-line)., So here we are taking raw data-point/querypoint from this function "final_fun_1(data_point)"., so internally this function featurize the raw data point and loads all our pretrained models finally it will return revenue for the given data point.
